# Downloader Scripts

This is a small repository with some scripts written in Bash and Batch to download files from a larger collection. Have a website or an open directory, or even an FTP connection with a collection of files that you want to transfer? Wget may be your answer.

These can be used for transferring files between computers, but I've also used it for something like the Syncfusion Succinctly books collection.
